    // Its a creational design pattern.
    // Builder pattern was introduced to solve some of the problems with Factory and
    // Abstract Factory design patterns when the Object contains a lot of
    // attributes.

    // Suppose if a class have a lot of attributes out of that a vary minimum is
    // mandatory and other are all optional.

    // So either we have a constructor with all the attributes and while creating object
    // if we don't need the optional attributes then we need to pass them as null.
    // Also we can have multiple constructor with combination of attributes but if
    // any new combination required them we have to come back an create new constructor
    // and there might be also some issue arise due to constructor with same might
    // signature might present.
